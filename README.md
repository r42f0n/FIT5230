Malicious AI
GIST
●       Get into teams of 2   (or 3 if   you provide strong   justifications,   or   you’re   free   to   do   it individually if   you’dlike to)
●         Choose a side:   Light vs   Dark
○       Light: your team’s aim   is to   vary/advance   existing   techniques   to   fight/counter malicious   AI
○       Dark: your team’s aim   is to   vary/advance   existing   techniques   to   do   malicious AI
●         Choose a theme:
○         AudioSeal:
■       Light: AudioSeal   is a countermeasure   against   generativeAI
■       Dark:   adversarial   ML   attacks   on AudioSeal
■         Paper(s):
●       https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2401.17264
■         Code(s):
●       https://github.com/facebookresearch/audioseal
■       Note: this   theme is   based   on   ZiQian’s   PhD   focus,   students   who   have   good ideas on how to   vary the baselines may   post their   ideas to   the         FIT5230 Ed discussion forum or email ZiQian for comments.   Note   that tutors/PhD students are not expected to help   debug   code,   as it is   the students’ responsibility to build on/vary the baseline codes as   part   of   their   assignment
○         Text-to-Image (TTI):
■       Light: any way to   counter TTI?   e.g.   check   if something   is   output from   TTI or   not?
■       Dark: TTI   is a   generativeAI   model,   so   it’s   considered   dark   (can   be   exploited   by   malicious   people to generate   realistic fakes
■         Paper(s):
●       InstructPix2Pix:   Learning to   Follow   Image   Editing   Instructions
